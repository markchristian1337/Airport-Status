Assign2: Due 11:59PM March 1st

Take small steps. Start with a canary test and one or two more tests.
List your tests in a file named tests.txt. Check them off with a x as you 
implement them. Remember to ask for a review each day. The earlier you start,
the earlier you finish, the less the risk. If you start late, you carry a 
bigger risk. Your call. Now to the problem.

A file contains a list of airport codes, one line each. For example:
IAH
IAD
SFO
LAX
PHX
PDX
ORD
BWI
MSP

The webservice at <https://soa.smext.faa.gov/asws/api/airport/status/IAH> 
returns a few details at the airport, including name, city, state, 
temperature, and delay. You can replace IAH with other codes to get details about other airports.

Write a console application that will list the following output:

-----
Name  City  State  Temperature  Delay?
... rows sorted by the name of the airport ...

Error getting details for:
... rows of airport codes for which there was an error ...
-----

For Delay, leave it blank if there is no delay, otherwise print a symbol to indicate a delay. 

The program should gracefully handle invalid airport codes and also network errors.
                                    
Please bring forward the practices, techniques, and tools you have learned so far. This includes:

Program fails gracefully on network error[5]: -5

All tests pass [10]:

Test quality [20]: -10
Significant part of the tests for talking to the service is missing. This involves extensive use of mocking and learning the techniques to avoid network calls to enable unit testing.

All tests except one do not rely on network [5]: -5
These tests are largely missing.

Code coverage [10]: -3

Design quality [20]: -15

Unnecessary constructor in Airport

Significant part of the design still missing, that is, code to talk to the service and parse the data.

Code quality [10]: -1

Place constructors before any getters.
